    In 2016 I began my journey into professional Information Technology, starting at <a href="https://www.northampton.edu">Northampton Community Colleg</a> in Bethlehem Pennsylvania.
    My degree's focus was for Cisco networking, and getting my CCNA, however I was always fascinated by programming.
    Upon finishng my core curriculum I began in help desk type roles for various companies, Spartech Solutions, Party City, and Tiffany and Company are just a few that I have been a part of.
    Toward the end of 2018 is when I truely began to cultivate my love of programming by beginning with learning Visual basic in Microsoft Access.
    After many fruitless efforts, a good friend of mine helped me find Python, where I then absorbed more than I ever did with Visual Basic.
